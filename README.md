# cvless

Cvless is a minimalist theme for static websites built with Jekyll. The theme strives for simplicity and readability by following best practices of web design, including the use of [high contrast](https://www.contrastrebellion.com), [law of proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity), and [responsive layout](https://responsivedesign.is). Its typography is based on the Alegreya typeface, one of the 53 Fonts of the Decade selected by the _Association Typographique Internationale_ (2011).

Placing a CV with picture directly on the homepage, cvless aims to discourage wordy introductions and highlight professional achievements. If you print the homepage, the layout automatically changes to give the CV a more traditional appearance. This means you no longer have to maintain a separate CV for offline distribution.

See [my personal website](https://piazzai.github.io) to get a better sense of what the theme looks like.

### Main features

-   Extensive use of the Alegreya superfamily, courtesy of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), gives your website a classic but dynamic feel.
-   Hundreds of icons sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons), and [Nonacademicons](https://github.com/piazzai/nonacademicons) enrich your links to internal or external documents, online services, and social media.
-   The design responsively switches to a one-column grid when viewed on small screens, allowing more comfortable visualization on smartphones.
-   Jekyll plugins automatically handle search engine optimization, converting the title and description of your site into metadata and creating a sitemap.
-   Optional integration of Google Analytics code enables monitoring of website traffic.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Rename it to `[username].github.io`.
3.  Start editing!

## Configuration

Most of the site's configuration happens in `_config.yml`. The website's HTML uses variables set within this file, so that changing things here will affect the site's appearance and behavior.

Many variables are mandatory and failing to set them will break parts of the HTML. Some variables are optional and can be omitted without consequence. This can be done by either deleting the line or commenting it out with `#`, as in the following example:

```yaml
organization: University of Git
#department:   Department of Jekyll
address:      123 Main St, Anytown, USA
```

Below is a list of all the variables and their descriptions.

| Variable                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `photo`                                         | The (optional) path to a personal picture that appears at the top of your CV. If omitted, the CV picture defaults to the avatar of your GitHub account.                                                                                                                                  |
| `organization`<br />`department`<br />`address` | Three lines of contact details that appear at the top of your CV and in the website's footer.

| `phone`                                         | Your phone number (optional), which also appears among your contact details.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `navtext`                                       | A short text (optional) that links to an external or internal web page. If included, this appears at the right end of the website's header. If a link to another page is not needed, `navtext` can be used as a short tagline that describes your job or interests, or omitted entirely. |
| `navlink`                                       | The (optional) URL to which `navtext` should redirect in case you wish to use it as a link. If this is omitted but `navtext` is not, `navtext` is rendered as plain text.                                                                                                                |

| `scholar`                                       | The (optional) URL of your profile on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com). If included, this is linked by a Google Scholar icon in the website's footer.                                                                                                                        |
| `orcid`                                         | The (optional) URL of your profile on [ORCID](https://orcid.org). If included, this is linked by an ORCID icon in the website's footer.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `lichess`                                       | Your username on [Lichess](https://lichess.org) (optional). If included, this is linked by a Lichess icon in the website's footer. Unless you are a chess player you will not need this, but it is there to demonstrate that you can link pretty much anything through a footer icon.    |
| `github`                                        | Your username on GitHub. This is linked by a GitHub icon in the website's footer and used to source your CV picture unless `photo` is specified.                                                                                                                                         |
| `analytics`                                     | Your [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) Tracking ID (optional). You can find this on the dashboard of your Analytics account after adding your website to the list of tracked sites. If included, this automatically enables tracking.                                     |
| `repo`                                          | The URL of your website's repository, which is linked in the website's footer.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The final lines of `_config.yml` list some Jekyll plugins needed for search engine optimization and to help web crawler index your site. In the interest of having your site place well in search results, do not delete or modify these lines.

## Usage

The file `index.md` should be edited to include the body of your CV. Whatever you write here will be shown along with your contact details and photo on the homepage. You can print the CV to PDF through your browser, as you would for any web page, but also through the print button that appears in the footer. Depending on your browser, this button may be the only way to access print layout options, where you can remove the metadata (page title, URL, timestamp, etc.) that by default appear along the borders of the printed page.

To write your CV, you can use the usual [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax), possibly with the inclusion of HTML elements like images or icons. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons), and [Nonacademicons](https://github.com/piazzai/nonacademicons) are automatically loaded by the theme and offer a wide selection of icons for your use. For example, the following code outputs one icon from each pack, in varying size:

```html
<i class="fab fa-github"></i>
<i class="ai ai-repec ai-lg"></i>
<i class="nai nai-lichess nai-4x"></i>
```

See the icon packs' documentation for more detailed usage instructions.

## Customization

### Accent color

By default, the accent color is set to a dark blue with hex code 001489. To change this to a color of your choosing, you need to follow two steps. First, open `assets/style.css` and look for the following chunks:

```css
a:link, a:visited {
  color: #001489;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

```css
#titlebar:hover {
  border-bottom: .4em solid #001489;
  text-decoration: none;
}

#navbar {
  color: #001489;
  font-family: "Alegreya SC", serif;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  font-weight: 400;
  text-transform: lowercase;
}
```

You should change the hex code in these chunks to the one corresponding to your chosen color. You can use [an online tool](https://colorpicker.me) to convert colors into hex codes. You can also write the name of any [HTML color](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/html-color-names) in place of the hex code, as in the example below:

```css
a:link, a:visited {
  color: firebrick;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

```css
#titlebar:hover {
  border-bottom: .4em solid firebrick;
  text-decoration: none;
}

#navbar {
  color: firebrick;
  font-family: "Alegreya SC", serif;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  font-weight: 400;
  text-transform: lowercase;
}
```

After taking care of this, the second step is minifying the CSS. You can do this easily with [another online tool](https://cssminifier.com): just copy the full content of `assets/style.css` into the input field and paste the content of the output field into `assets/style.min.css`. Do not skip this step or your changes to the CSS will be ignored.

### Favicon

The theme ships with a favicon consisting of the letters CV in lowercase Alegreya serif against a round white background. You can substitute this for any icon of your choosing by replacing `favicon.ico` in the site's root folder. [This website](https://favicon.io) is very helpful to create your own favicon from an image, text, or emoji.

## Extensions

### Adding a page

One extra page (beyond the home) can be added to your site with minimal effort. For example, if you are an academic, you might want to add a page about your research interests. In order to do this, you should first create a new text file called `research.md` and give it the following front matter:

```yml
---
layout: default
title: Research
---
```

Then, open `_config.yml` and change the values of `navtext` and `navlink`:

```yml
navtext:      Research
navlink:      research.md
```

Done! Your new page will now appear in the navigation bar. Like the home, you can write it in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and HTML.

### Adding one more page

Perhaps you want to add two extra pages instead of one. For example, if you are an academic, you might want to have two additional pages for your research and teaching interests. In the case of a second extra page, the procedure is slightly more involved as it requires deeper edits.

First, create a new text file called `teaching.md` and specify default layout in the front matter, as previously did for `research.md`. Then, open `_config.yml` and, right below the lines specifying `navtext` and `navlink`, add:

```yml
navtext2:     Teaching
navlink2:     teaching.md
```

Next, open the file `_includes/header.html` and look for the following code chunk:

```html
{% if site.navtext %}
{% if site.navlink %}
<div class="right column">
  <a href="{{ site.navlink }}" id="navbar">{{ site.navtext }}</a>
</div>
{% else %}
<div class="right column">
  {{ site.navtext }}
</div>
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

This governs the behavior of `navtext` and `navlink`. You need to replicate it for your two new variables. Add the following code immediately below:

```html
{% if site.navtext2 and site.navlink2 %}
<div class="right column">
  <a href="{{ site.navlink2 }}" id="navbar">{{ site.navtext2 }}</a>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

Now the navigation bar will display both extra pages, but only if the values of `navtext2` and `navlink2` are set in the configuration file. The use of [Liquid control flow](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow) ensures that, if you change your mind later and wish to remove the second extra page, you can delete or comment out these variables in `_config.yml` without further changing `_includes/header.html`.

You could, in principle, repeat this procedure to add as many pages as you want, but you are likely to run out of space in the navigation bar. The theme is intended for a simple website that focuses on your CV.

### Adding footer icons

Depending on your job and interests, you might want to change the icons linking to various online services that appear in the footer. Google Scholar, ORCID, and Lichess icons are supported by default (in addition to GitHub, which is mandatory). To include these icons in the footer, you only have to set the relevant variables in `_config.yml`.

You can easily add other profiles. For example, you might want to have a link to your Twitter handle. Font Awesome provides a Twitter icon, with name `fab fa-twitter-square`. In order to include this in the footer, first create a variable with your username in the configuration file:

```yml
twitter:      username
```

Suppose you want to add the Twitter icon right before the GitHub icon in the footer. Open `_includes/footer.html` and look for the following code chunk:

```html
{% if site.github %}
<a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}" class="fab fa-2x fa-github-square" title="GitHub" id="icon"></a>
{% endif %}
```

Right above, insert the following:

```html
{% if site.twitter %}
<a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}" class="fab fa-2x fa-twitter-square" title="Twitter" id="icon"></a>
{% endif %}
```

Done! Now the footer will display the Twitter icon. Like before, [Liquid code](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) ensures that if you later change your mind later you can simply delete or comment out the Twitter variable in `_config.yml` without further hassle.

Take a look at the [Font Awesome icon pack](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) for an overview of all the icons you can use. If you are an academic, chances are you will not find some of the icons you need, but you could find them in the [Academicons pack](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons). If they are not there either, or if you are looking for icons unrelated to academia, please consider making a request for new icons to be added to [Nonacademicons](https://github.com/piazzai/nonacademicons).
