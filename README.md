# cvless (under construction)

Cvless is a minimalist theme for static websites built with Jekyll. The theme strives for simplicity and readability by following best practices of web design, including the use of [high contrast](https://www.contrastrebellion.com), [law of proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity), and [responsive layout](https://responsivedesign.is). Its typography is based on the Alegreya font family, one of the 53 Fonts of the Decade selected by the _Association Typographique Internationale_ (2011).

Placing a CV with picture directly on the homepage, cvless aims to discourage wordy introductions and highlight professional achievements. Printing the homepage automatically removes some design elements in order to give the CV a more traditional (paperlike) feel. This means you no longer have to maintain a separate CV for PDF distribution.

See [my personal website](https://piazzai.github.io) to get a better sense of what the theme looks like.

## Main features

## Installation

## Usage

### Printing

You can print the CV through your browser, as you would for any web page, but also through the print button that appears in the theme's footer. Depending on your browser, using this button may be the only way to access layout options, where you can remove the metadata (page title, URL, timestamp, etc.) that by default appears along the borders of the printed page.
